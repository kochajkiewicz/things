Unless you're well versed in 2020s front-end development, namely:

* dealing with abandoned plugins
* deciphering strange-looking, non-descriptive errors
* working with dependencies you don't fully understand the purpose of

The official guide to bundling might cause some frustration.

If you are, like me, familiar with some basic Terminal commands and package installation but have always steered clear of more advanced infrastructure tasks, do yourself a favour and use the [Figma Plugin React Template](https://github.com/nirsky/figma-plugin-react-template).

It installed and ran without errors on first try. Which, as far as my adventures with front-end engineering go, is a win that keeps me going.
