There's a question I always liked asking other designers when talking about work. 

How did you know you were making progress?

The answer was usually a description of some flavour of a design process—the difference in approaches within our field can be quite interesting. There's always something to learn or, better yet, steal to make my execution of the [Unsexy Middle Bits](https://medium.com/@cwodtke/designs-unsexy-middle-bits-a8cc17f0246d) more effective.

Then there was my favourite follow-up.

How did you know you were successful?

There was a look, a pause, and the answer, tinged with disbelief.

"We launched?"

Earlier this year, I spent a large chunk of my time interviewing product designer candidates. Screening calls feel like ticking off a checklist during an awkward first dance, so why not just chat design instead?

I asked my questions and, almost without fail, the success definition for a lot of the projects I heard about was "the launch". And a few seconds of awkward silence afterwards.

One last difficult conversation, a final round of revisions, a handover to engineering makes progress look and feel like success. Time and budgets make milestones matter more than solved problems. 

I wrote the opening paragraph of this note when the lockdown first started. I stopped when I realised how much of my work doesn't have a success metric—its only outcome is a concluded contract or a closed ticket. And I realised the question I so liked isn't fair.

"What did you want to know from the customers who'd used it?"
