description: So I can learn how to learn.

A colleague asked me what's my trick to collecting information I find online. Nothing he's tried so far – bookmarks, read-later services, Roam, the guilt-inducing "leave tab open so I finish" – worked. I managed to impress him for on two occasions, having had just the right bookmark to share over Slack.\
\
That made me think about my learning methods, and how fleeting interest and distractions get in the way of exploring concepts fully. What I mean by "fully". And how none of the tools I tried, worked.\
\
Quitting some and limiting other social networks helped with distractions. \
\
Ring-fencing time to read every evening helped with discipline.\
\
But I still don't know how to effectively organise my bookmarks list, or what web of connections should replace my google searches when asked about a concept I vaguely remember being interested in – consumed by – for a couple of hours a while back.
